Developed a Python game using Tkinter within a 4-week deadline, where players navigate a balloon through obstacles in the sky.
Designed a progressive difficulty system, increasing balloon speed over time to enhance gameplay challenge.
Implemented a leader board to track high scores, a boss key for instant screen concealment, and a cheat code granting 10 seconds of invincibility.
